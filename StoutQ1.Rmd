Name: Adeep Avinash Kulkarni
Question: Stout Case Study Q1
Position: Data and Digital Analytics Intern

Let's import the dataset first and store it into a data frame

```{R}
library(tidyverse)
loan_data <- read_csv('/Users/adeepkulkarni/Downloads/loans_full_schema.csv')
str(loan_data)
```
Let's check the first six elements of the dataframe using the head() function

```{R}
head(loan_data)
```
Basically, the dataset represents set of elements and entries of every loan made from one entity to another. The data that exists is
about information about the loans and the entities themselves.

Problem with the dataset is that there are too many null values and missing data but since the number of entries is relatively high it should not cause a huge issue with the analysis of said loan data.

Let's start with creating five visualizations of this data.

Before we do however, we need to export few libraries we will be using for the visualization and the prediction models.

```{R}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggmap)
library(readr)
library(tidyr)
library(readr)
```

Let's start the first visualization by understanding what the map function does.

We will do a visualization to check the number of loans accepted per US state on this map of the United States

```{R}
usa_map <- map_data("state")
loan_data %>% mutate(state_name=state.name[match(state,state.abb)]) %>% mutate(state_name=str_to_lower(state_name)) %>% filter(is.na(state_name)==FALSE) %>% group_by(state_name) %>% mutate(state_count = n()) %>% select(state_name,state_count) %>% unique() %>% ggplot() + geom_map(map = usa_map, aes(map_id = state_name, fill = state_count)) +
  expand_limits(x = usa_map$long, y = usa_map$lat) +
  labs(title = "Accepted loans statewide") 
```

As we can see from the map, the most loans are in California, Texas and New York states.

To confirm let's also do a comparative bar plot of the states data

```{r}
loan_data %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  mutate(state_count = n()) %>%
  select(state,state_count) %>%
  unique() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(state, state_count), y = state_count, fill = state, label = state_count)) +
  geom_col() +
  geom_text(nudge_y = 150) +
  labs(x = "State", y = "", title = "Loans per US state") 
```


While we are on the topic of bar plots, let's do one for loan purpose

```{R}
loan_data %>%
  group_by(loan_purpose) %>%
  mutate(loan_purpose_count = n()) %>%
  select(loan_purpose,loan_purpose_count) %>%
  unique() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(loan_purpose,loan_purpose_count), y = loan_purpose_count, fill = loan_purpose, label = loan_purpose_count)) +
  geom_col() +
  geom_text(nudge_y = 150) +
  labs(x = "Purpose", y = "", title = "Loans for every purpose") 
```
From the diagram we can make out that loans are most used for debt consolidation and paying off credit card bills

Now we will plot a boxplot with regard to loan grade in the loan data

```{R}
loan_data %>% ggplot(aes(x = grade, y = interest_rate, fill = grade)) + geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Grade of the loan", y = "Loan Interest rate", title = "Loan Interest Rates for every grade")
```
Highest grade is of D and E

```{R}
loan_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = interest_rate, color = homeownership)) +
  geom_density() +
  labs(x = "Interest rate of loan", y = "", title = "Loan Interest Rates per Home Ownership")
```
```{r}
loan_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = loan_data$interest_rate, color = loan_status)) +
  geom_density() +
  labs(x = "Interest amt", title = "Loan Interest Rates per Loan Status")
```
We drew 2 density plots of loan status v loan home ownership record with respect to its interest rate.

```{R}
loan_data %>% filter(loan_amount > 8) %>% ggplot(aes(x = loan_amount, y = interest_rate)) +geom_point(color = "red") +
  scale_x_log10() +
  labs(x = "Loan Amount", y = "Interest Rate", title = "Interest Rate vs. Loan Amount")
```

```{R}
loan_data %>% filter(loan_amount > 10) %>% ggplot(aes(x = loan_amount, y = paid_late_fees)) +geom_point(color = "green") +
  scale_x_log10() +
  labs(x = "Loan Amt", y = "Late Fees", title = "Loan Amount v Late Fees")
```
Here we saw the comparison using point graph of loan amount v late fees and loan amount v interest

Now let's do the Machine Learning

Since we have to predict a numeric value we have to use a regression model

```{r}
lm_model <- lm(interest_rate~loan_data$annual_income,data=loan_data)
summary(lm_model)
```
The P-value is low and Rsquared is also low if we use income to predict the interest rate

Now let's try multiple regression to predict interest rate using multiple variables

```{r}
multireg <- lm(interest_rate ~ annual_income + debt_to_income + delinq_2y,data=loan_data)
summary(multireg)
```
The best predictor remains annual income. 

Hence, to predict the interest rate we use regression techniques and do the 5 visualizations in this program. Lasso regression can be used if I had more time.
